\cvsection{Application}
Dear Sophie Ingemann Aagaard.
\\
\vspace{5mm}

It is with great excitement that I submit my application to Inwatec's Automation and PLC programming position.
\newline

I am a graduate within Software Engineering and with great interest in data analytics, IoT and automation.
I have decided to send Inwatec my application, after a quick talk with a recruitment agent from Odense Robotics at Tech-Talent Conference in Odense, who opened my eyes to the many challenges, technologies and solutions that Inwatec provides to its customers.
\\

During my studies I have developed neural networks such as feed-forward, Restricted Boltzmann Machine, self-organizing maps from scratch, as well as worked with a number of frameworks and libraries for artificial intelligence. 
Therefore, even though I have not worked with Open CV before, I have a solid understanding of classification tasks with the use of artificial intelligence.
Moreover, I have experience in a number of different statistical machine learning techniques that might come in handy for pre-processing tasks or as supplementary classification methods.
\\
In the job post, you mention computer-vision and image classification as being central to the position. 
In my studies, i have worked with image recognition both for processing handwriting and for identification of individual faces of whales across images.

At the Mærsk McKinney Møller Institute, I have received hands-on experience with the development of custom circuits and integration with the AtMega328p CPU.
In relation to this, I also have some experience with writing C++ programs, which I expect will come in handy when programming PLCs.

\vspace{5mm}
Thank you in advance for the time you dedicated to my application. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
\\

Best regards,\\
\cvsubsection{Emil Sebastian Rømer}
